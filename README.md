# Minttu Runtime

Minttu Runtime is the foundational web framework package for [Omnifi](https://omnifi.foundation) projects, built on [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev). It's intended to be used across a broad spectrum of web applications, but is driven by the needs of **Omnifi** and our family of projects.
